# CVE-2024-26304 - Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in ArubaOS

## Overview

**CVE-2024-26304** is a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting **ArubaOS** due to a buffer overflow in its L2/L3 Management service. An attacker can exploit this by sending specially crafted packets to the **PAPI** (Process Application Programming Interface) UDP port **8211**, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

### CVSS Score: 9.8 (Critical)
- **Attack Vector**: Network
- **Attack Complexity**: Low
- **Privileges Required**: None
- **User Interaction**: None
- **Confidentiality Impact**: High
- **Integrity Impact**: High
- **Availability Impact**: High

## Affected Products

- ArubaOS systems with vulnerable versions
- Systems using the **PAPI UDP port 8211**

Refer to [Aruba's official advisory](https://www.arubanetworks.com/assets/alert/ARUBA-PSA-2024-004.txt) for details on affected versions.

## Exploitation

An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious packets to the PAPI UDP port. Successful exploitation results in arbitrary code execution, enabling the attacker to take complete control over the device.
